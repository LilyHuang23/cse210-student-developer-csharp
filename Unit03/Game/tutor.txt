if word contains the guess
    use word.replace() to replace all isntances of the underscore with the guess

    for each letter in the word
        set a new string to the old string except with every instance of 
        underscore replaced with the guess

.replace(): what does it do?

wordUnderLine: " _ _ _ _ _" (shark)

guess: 'k'

if word contains 'k':
    wordUnderLine will replace every underscore with a 'k'

result: "kkkkk"

Revision: replace wordUnderLine string with a dictionary containing
a key-pair value for every letter in the secret word

example:
* secret word is "shark"
* therefore the wordUnderLine will be:

{
    s: " _",
    h: " _",
    ...
}
